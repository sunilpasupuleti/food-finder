            </Typography>
            <Typography variant="body1" color="text.secondary">
              This project was developed as a collaborative effort by a team of
              four students using React and Material UI. The goal was not just
              to build a working app, but to design a visually appealing,
              accessible, and fully functional user experience that leverages
              real-world development practices.
